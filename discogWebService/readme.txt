I followed CodeIgniter’s PHP style guide for the assignment but reverted to camel case in parts of my 
custom library files as I had previously written my Mobile Web App in that style. Only two URI's are necessary 
to "hook up" with my Mobile Web App, the rest (lol), are for demonstration purposes.
